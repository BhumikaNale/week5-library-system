Library Management System (Python OOP)

A console-based Library Management System developed using Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

This project simulates real-world library operations such as managing books, registering members, borrowing/returning books, tracking due dates, and calculating overdue fines.

> Features:
Add new books
Register new members
Borrow and return books
Automatic due date calculation (14 days)
Overdue fine calculation (₹2 per day)
Search books by title, author, or ISBN
View library statistics
JSON-based data persistence
Menu-driven user interface

>Technologies Used:
Python 3
JSON (File Handling)
datetime module
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

> OOP Concepts Implemented:
Classes and Objects
Encapsulation
Abstraction
Class Relationships
Dictionary-based Data Management
